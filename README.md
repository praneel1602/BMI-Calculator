# BMI-Calculator
This is a simple webapp made using HTML, CSS and Javacript to calculate the BMI of the person.
You can give your height in cm, m, feet or inches according to your convenience and also your weight in g, kg or lbs so that you don't need to do any conversion.
You will get your BMI and also an image corresponding to your body-type will be displayed.
If any wrong input is given BMI won't be calculated and you will get an error message.
